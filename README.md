# multi-agent (path finding) planning framework

Mapf is a (currently experimental) Rust library for multi-agent planning, with
a focus on cooperative path finding.

This repo is just getting started, so please bear with us for a while as we work
towards making useful tools.

This is being developed as part of the [Open-RMF](https://github.com/open-rmf)
project which provides an open source framework for enabling interoperability
between heterogeneous fleets of mobile robots, including cooperation across
different platforms and vendors.
