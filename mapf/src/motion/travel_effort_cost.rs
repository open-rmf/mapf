    /// one second earlier. These measures are proportional, so in general a
    /// detour of `t * meters` translation and `t * radians` spinning will be
    /// allowed to arrive at the goal `t` seconds earlier.
    ///
    /// "Detour" in this context means taking a path which is longer than the
    /// shortest available path to the goal. This can be advantageous if the
    /// shortest possible path is crowded with moving obstacles that will slow
    /// down the agent's ability to make progress. Therefore the `meters` and
    /// `radians` weights will only have an effect in the presence of moving
    /// obstacles which would delay the agent if it were to move along the
    /// shortest possible path to its goal.
    ///
    /// Broadly speaking, larger values tend to result in longer planning times
    /// in environments cluttered with dynamic obstacles or other moving agents.
    /// That's because they allow for longer detours and finding those detours
    /// requires more exploration. Using small values here can make planning
    /// times faster, but then the agent is less likely to search for time-saving
    /// detours, for better or worse.
